Services used: API from d-portal.org for Sida activities, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, ocrmypdf, k Nearest Neighbour algorithm  
  
Steps to carry out solution:  
1) Obtained API from website d-portal.org containing International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data, so as to fetch 250 different activities in files that might or might not contain results. This is a small sample of the ~100,000 files available.
2) We screened the 250 activities and by the website's coding classification, shortlisted 169 activities containing results 
- Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook for running scripts over cloud  
- ocrmypdf to carry out optical character recognition of pdf files  
- k Nearest Neighbor algorithm for determining the frequency of key words  
  
Languages used    
- Python3
